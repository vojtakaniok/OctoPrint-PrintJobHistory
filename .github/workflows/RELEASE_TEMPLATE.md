### NOTE: this plugin has been abandoned by the original creator and adopted here by a new maintainer

**This plugin is under new management** and will focus on critical bug fixes to start. Please bear with me as I get acclimated to this new plugin.

If you would like to support these new efforts, please consider buying me a coffee or two. Thank you!
