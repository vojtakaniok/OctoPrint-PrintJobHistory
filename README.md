The OctoPrint-Plugin stores all print-job information of a print in a local database.
This information is collected from OctoPrint itself, but also from other plugins. See [below](#Optional-Plugins) for more information about these plugins.

#### *NOTE: this plugin was once again abandoned ! Hopefully I will keep support longer*

If you would like to support these new efforts, please consider buying me a coffee or two. Thank you!

## Setup

Install via the bundled [Plugin Manager](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/vojtakaniok/OctoPrint-PrintJobHistory/releases/latest/download/main.zip

After installation, you can listen on three release channels (since 1.6.0).
What does this mean: Each channel has its own release-version and each release has a different kind of functionality and stability.

- **"Only Release"**: Only stable and tested versions will be shown in the software-update section of OctoPrint
- **"Release & Candidate"**: Beside the stable release, you can also see the "release-candidates", like '''1.7.0rc3'''.
  The rc's includde new functionalty/bugfixes and are already tested by the community.. so by YOU ;-)
- **"Release & Candidate & in Development"**: Beside stable and rc, you will be informed about development versions.
  A development version like '''1.8.0.dev5``` could include a new (experimental) feature/bugfixs, but it is not fully tested by the community

Changing between each release is done via the "Software Update section" in the settings.

**!!! If you use the development-channel, you can use the latest feature and can improve the quality of the plugin !!!**

Hint: "Easy-switching" is possible with OctoPrint-Version 1.8.0 (see https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/4238).
At the meantime you need to uninstall and install the version you like from the selected channel...or stay in one channel ;-)


## Roadmap
